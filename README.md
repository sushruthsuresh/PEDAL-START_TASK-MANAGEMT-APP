First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:
1.Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2.Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init -y in the terminal.
3.Install Express by running npm install express.
4.Create a new file named server.js and implement the RESTful API.

To run this code(BACK END):
1.Save the code above into a file named server.js.
2.Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing server.js.
3.Run node server.js to start the server.

Now, your RESTful API is up and running, and you can use tools like Postman to test the endpoints:
GET '/tasks' to retrieve all tasks.
POST '/tasks' to create a new task.
GET '/tasks/':id to retrieve a single task by its ID.
PUT '/tasks/':id to update an existing task.
DELETE '/tasks/':id to delete a task.
